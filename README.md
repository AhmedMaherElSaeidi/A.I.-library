# Library Management System

## Overview

The Library Management System is a comprehensive web-based application that enables users to efficiently manage a library's collection of books. This system was developed using HTML, CSS, JavaScript for the front-end, and PHP and SQL for the back-end. It caters to different user roles, providing a rich set of features for both library staff and patrons.
The A.I. stands for Ahmed & Ibrahim the developers of the website and on that basis our logo was founded.
The library passed by two core proccesses, the first process was the implementation of the front-end using html & css and that was at my first year at college, and the second proccess was introducing the website in a dynamic way by adding back-end using PHP and SQl.
